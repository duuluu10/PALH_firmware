#### This repository contains modified Marlin firmware for converting a Creality Ender-3 3D printer with V4.2.7 board into a Personal Automated Liquid Handler (PALH).

The firmware modifications enable the printer to function both as a 3D printer for producing necessary parts and as a specialized liquid handling system.

## Repository Structure ##

This repository consists of two main branches:

** Marlin 2.1.2.2 - Printer Branch **

This branch contains firmware modifications for printing all necessary parts for the pipettor and the deck. 

Use this branch when you need to print components for your PALH conversion. 

Key features include:

* Extended bed size to accommodate larger prints
* Optimized settings for precise part production
* Built firmware to use directly with the 3D printer

Move "firmware-printer.bin" along with any 3D printable .gcode files directly to a microSD to update the firmware and print

** Marlin 2.1.2.2 - PALH Branch **

This branch includes firmware modifications specifically for executing specialized protocols on the Personal Automated Liquid Handler. 

It enables the converted Ender-3 to perform liquid handling tasks.

Move "firmware_PALH_v1.3.1.1.bin" along with any custom .gcode, or .gcode files generated by the "gcode_generator_v1_1.py" directly to a microSD to update the firmware and execute protocol
